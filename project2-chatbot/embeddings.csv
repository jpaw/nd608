0,"2023 Fashion Trend: Red. Glossy red hues took over the Fall 2023 runways ranging from Sandy Liang and PatBo to Tory Burch and Wiederhoeft. Think: Juicy reds with vibrant orange undertones that would look just as good in head-to-toe looks (see: a pantsuit) as accent accessory pieces (shoes, handbags, jewelry).","[ 0.004214    0.03042773  0.02591187 ...  0.02056287 -0.00668927

1,"2023 Fashion Trend: Cargo Pants. Utilitarian wear is in for 2023, which sets the stage for the return of the cargo pant. But these aren't the shapeless, low-rise pants of the Y2K era. For spring, this trend is translated into tailored silhouettes, interesting pocket placements, elevated fabrics like silk and organza, and colors that go beyond khaki and olive.","[ 0.02335154  0.04474806  0.0469203  ... -0.01118702  0.01577285

2,"2023 Fashion Trend: Sheer Clothing. ""Bare it all"" has been the motto since the end of the lockdown. In 2023,  naked dressing makes its way from the red carpet – where celebrities like Cher and Rihanna have been sporting the trend forever – to street style. From a cellophane-like dress, worn over a boldly hued maxi skirt at Tory Burch's spring 2023 show, to a frothy frock revealing undergarments at Victoria Beckham, the previously risqué trend is coming not only for your weekend wardrobe but even workwear.","[ 0.07534371  0.01764669  0.02343941 ...  0.02323481 -0.00053308

3,"2023 Fashion Trend: Denim Reimagined. From double-waisted jeans to carpenter jeans, it's been a while since we were this excited about denim trends. It seems like even the most luxe runway designers agree, sending out strapless dresses, shirting, and even undergarments and shoes (thigh-high-boot-jean hybrids anyone?) in the material. Whatever category you decide on, opt for timeless cuts and silhouettes that can stay in your closet rotation once the novelty wears off.","[ 0.03882644  0.04282642  0.01565324 ... -0.01227326  0.00773329

4,"2023 Fashion Trend: Shine For The Daytime. The amount of shine on the 2023 runways would make you think we are back in the Roaring '20s. While sequins may feel over as soon as the clock strikes midnight on January 31, this year, designers are making a case for ""daytime shine"" – wearable separates that can spice up even the most basic staples like tank tops (see above) and blue jeans. While this trend comes in all metallic shades (gold, bronze, rose gold etc.), we are partial to the liquid silver look that can double as a neutral.","[ 0.01441671 -0.00710455 -0.01736234 ... -0.01178901  0.02178728

5,"2023 Fashion Trend: Maxi Skirts. In response to the ultra unpractical mini skirts of 2022, maxi skirts are here to dominate the year. In line with the aforementioned cargo and denim trends, expect lots of low-rise, pocket-adorned silhouettes and floor-grazing jean skirts, as well as styles in various prints and unexpected materials like velvet.

6,"2023 Fashion Trend: Cobalt Blue. The strongest color story to come out of Spring 2023 runways, cobalt blue has burst through the collections with the freshness of a sea mist on a morning day. Just bright enough to warrant a double take, yet subtle enough to be worked into daily wear, it's the type of deep blue that will excite even the most color-averse. Bonus points: It pairs well with Pantone's Viva Magenta.","[ 0.0454071   0.02028488 -0.00214058 ...  0.0063433   0.01455765

7,"Sculptural Bags That Make a Simple Statement. Under the accessories category, CEO and founder of Caitlin Jaymes Organizing & Styling, Caitlyn Jaymes is honing in on sculptural bags that are simple enough to be considered versatile but still make a statement.

“[For everyday use], I would purchase it in camel, ivory, or, if I wanted a color option, I would purchase pale green or pale yellow,” she tells InStyle. The style expert goes on to say she could style the staple item in a myriad of ways, but for a casual look, something along the lines of a “straight leg jeans, light knit cardigan, and a white slim sneaker” combo would be her go-to. For dressier occasions, she tells the dot com she’d likely “pair a slip satin long skirt with a white ribbed tank and pointed toe kitten heels.”","[ 0.04362425 -0.01114129  0.01114842 ... -0.02724377 -0.0140068

8,"All of the Pastels. Pastels are classic (albeit slightly cliche) for spring, but they’re often given a bad rap for feeling a bit cheesy. Personal stylist Allie McKenna is here to tell you they’re not.

“I am excited about color, especially lilac, pale yellow, and baby blue. I can’t wait to wear a baby blue midi skirt and a silky cami with some chunky colorful jewelry. I will always go for a statement shoe too, so a funky pair of 3-inch heels that compliment the outfit will be a must as well.”","[ 0.06221727 -0.00979193 -0.00267834 ... -0.001738    0.00753649

Fashion expert and stylist Naina Singla tells InStyle that if you’re going to invest in something new this spring, let it be a statement maxi skirt. “They are a versatile wardrobe staple worth investing in and are perfect for every season,” Singla gushes via email. Plus, with the surge of Y2K influence in the fashion sphere, Singla says long maxi styles with skirts fit the bill.

“A maxi skirt is a piece that easily transitions from day to night and comes in a range of styles,” she explains. “Right now, we are seeing denim, satin slip skirts, and knitted skirts in maxi length.”","[ 0.02660725  0.05268621  0.00711408 ... -0.00100333  0.00800259

Though the platform slip-ons you know and love from the 2000s have been in style for a while now (thanks, in part, to the almost-revival of Lizzie McGuire), personal stylist and image consultant Andie Sobrato tells InStyle the nostalgic footwear will be especially popular for spring 2023, with plenty of bold, printed pairs to choose from.

“I am excited to throw on a daisy, polka dot, or bright platform slip-on with a cropped jean and button-up shirt,” Sobrato says via email.” These relaxed and fun shoes will be the standout of any outfit and bring a youthful energy that we all need.”","[ 0.01718372 -0.00305678 -0.05056511 ...  0.01215482 -0.00702074

12,"More Mesh. Another Y2K-esque fashion statement to be made this spring: Mesh.

“In particular, a mesh long-sleeve top or bodycon dress,” Sobrato tells InStyle. “These mesh dresses and tops can be in a solid, bright color or featuring a bold print and are a perfect way to add texture and dimension to your wardrobe; they show just enough skin to be sexy but hide enough to leave mystery.”","[ 0.04553174  0.03612339 -0.020196   ...  0.01120145 -0.01173865

13,"Transparent Layering. Celebrities have been all over sheer dressing for a while now, but the spring runways prove that the see-through trend is ready to go mainstream. Nearly every designer experimented with whisper-thin fabrics, offering the option to bare it all under a gossamer-like piece (or play with peekaboo underwear). For a more office-appropriate take, you can play with layering various sheer pieces over one another.","[ 0.04830805  0.01632744 -0.00938662 ... -0.0209282  -0.02341367
